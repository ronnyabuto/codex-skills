# Readability Review

Review the requested files or current diff. These are readability heuristics, not evidence of authorship. Do not expand a small polish request into a whole-repository rewrite.

- Remove comments that merely restate obvious code or narrate obsolete changes.
- Keep explanations of non-obvious constraints, API contracts, invariants, live workarounds, license notices, documentation comments and tracked TODOs.
- Match local naming and formatting conventions. Rename only when the meaning becomes clearer; conventional names such as result or item are not inherently bad.
- Remove unfinished scaffolding only when it is unintended. Do not fabricate implementation to hide an intentional stub.
- Examine unnecessary indirection or duplication in context. Extract only when shared semantics are stable and maintenance benefits justify it; repetition alone is not a defect.
- Preserve boundary validation, error recovery and test isolation unless evidence establishes that they are redundant. Coverage and completeness are not suspicious by themselves.
- Review added tests for a concrete contract or regression they protect. Avoid assertions that merely repeat implementation or a mock's configured answer; scratch checks need not become permanent files. Retain useful existing tests regardless of age or authorship.

Follow project and user requirements. Use targeted verification for behavior changes; ordinary comment edits need only checks proportionate to their actual effects. Summarize meaningful changes and any material uncertainty.
