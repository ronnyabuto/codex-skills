# Evidence-Driven Testing

For test selection or maintenance, read [Useful tests](references/useful-tests.md). Verification need not add permanent tests or recordings; retain checks for meaningful uncovered behavior or regression risk. For test-design requests, return recommendations without starting a capture.

Capture evidence appropriate to the requested claim. Evidence supplements relevant checks; a video proves what was visible, not complete correctness.

1. Define the behavior or metric, starting conditions and meaningful assertions. Identify the revision and any uncommitted changes, environment and tested process.
2. Choose a measured probe for APIs/performance, screenshots for states, and a recording for multi-step visible behavior. Capture a before case for a bug fix when reproducible; otherwise disclose its absence.
3. Drive the real test and retain repeatable commands/scripts plus results. Mark blocked checks untested, with reasons. Observe the actual state before labeling an assertion passed.
4. Review the generated artifacts and summarize pass/fail, conditions and limitations. A recorder's successful rendering does not establish that an assertion was true.

For a GUI recording, read [references/recorder.md](references/recorder.md) and use the optional bundled recorder. For browser automation or a headless environment, read [references/headless.md](references/headless.md). Read only the chosen route.

Reuse the project's existing launch/verification recipe and already completed
checks when they cover the claim. This skill adds retained assertions and
reproducible evidence; it does not require a second full verification pass.
For a diff review already covered by `codex review`, use those findings rather
than repeating them as a project-wide audit.

Once the requested behavior and relevant checks pass, stop. Repeat or broaden verification only after a change, failure, or unresolved risk justifies it.

Follow existing authorization and user scope. Save locally unless external publication is requested or already authorized; naming a PR as context does not itself authorize a comment or upload. Keep recordings away from credentials, personal/customer data and unrelated desktop content. Scope/crop capture where appropriate. Do not install system packages or change project dependencies merely to create evidence without evaluating the available alternatives and permissions.

Never describe synthetic frames, stitched playback or static screenshots as a recording of live interaction. Include artifact paths and the exact check performed. If no capture capability is available, report that limit and retain whatever meaningful probe evidence can be obtained.
